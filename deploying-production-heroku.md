# Pros
	* Allows the software dev process to progress faster 
	* Enables the user to help define what the software will become
	* Better conforms to the users' software requirements
	* Higher quality software in the eye of the user

# Cons
	* Could provide versions that are not polished and with bugs

## Seems that this is a similar debate to AGILE vs WATERFALL development. Quick iterations focused on end-user/customer input/satisfaction versus the contemplated completeness of the release.
